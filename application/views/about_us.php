<strong>About Us</strong>
<p style="color:#000">
30minutesvape is your go-to online and in-store outlet to supply you with quality vape products at everyday low prices!
</p>

<p style="color:#000">
We bask in stocking a whopping range of Disposable Vape Devices, Vape
Kits, Hardware and more. Our volume of products may seem overwhelming, however, having a large range of products is essential for us to cater to all of our customers. No
 
Vaper is the same and we aim to serve every kind!
</p>

<p style="color:#000">
Sheffield Vape Outlet was born out of a desire to provide an informative and efficient online shopping experience for smokers looking to make the switch to vaping .</p>

<p style="color:#000">
The world of electronic cigarettes and vaping devices has evolved - and continues to grow - at a rapid rate. It can certainly be a confusing journey and we find great satisfaction in not
only supplying our valued customers with high-quality products but also offering in-house support and guidance wherever needed.
</p>
<p style="color:#000">
Customer safety, business legitimacy and lawfulness is essential to us. We take great pride in committing ourselves to fully TPD Complaint Products - an act brought in by the UK and European governments to regulate the advertising/sales of electronic cigarette products. All products listed in-store and online here at Sheffield Vape outlet are fully
compliant with these regulations. Not only that, we are devoted to educating, informing and protecting the public against any unregulated products they may come into contact with.</p>
<p style="color:#000">
We don’t just pride ourselves in being a vaping retailer but most importantly a community of vaping enthusiasts who vape exactly what we sell. That’s right! If we didn’t vape it, we wouldn’t sell it. You can expect 100% honesty and transparency when under our wing.
